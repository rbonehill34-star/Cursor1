3. **Delete User** (Danger, Red)
   - Only shown if NOT editing your own account
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Redirects to user list with success message
   - Protected against deleting self

## Security Features

### Password Management
- ✅ Passwords never displayed (always shown as ●●●●●●●●)
- ✅ Optional password change (blank = no change)
- ✅ New passwords hashed with `password_hash()`
- ✅ Minimum 6 characters for security

### Access Control

- ✅ Non-existent users redirect to user list

### Data Validation
- ✅ Username uniqueness check (except for current user)
- ✅ Username minimum length (3 characters)
- ✅ Password minimum length if provided (6 characters)
- ✅ Account type validation (must be valid enum value)
- ✅ SQL injection protection via prepared statements

### Session Management
- ✅ Updates session if user edits their own account
- ✅ Updates username in session
- ✅ Updates account_type in session
- ✅ Maintains login state throughout editing

## User Flow

### Viewing Users
1. Administrator logs in
2. Navigates to Practice Portal → Users
3. Sees list of all users
4. **Click any user row** to edit

### Editing a User
1. Click on user row in table
2. Redirected to `users/edit.php?id=X`
3. Form loads with current user data
4. **Modify fields as needed:**
   - Change username
   - Set new password (or leave blank)
   - Change account type
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Success message displayed
7. Can continue editing or return to user list

### Deleting a User
1. From edit user page
2. Click "Delete User" button (bottom right)
3. Confirm deletion in dialog
4. User deleted from database
5. Redirected to user list with success message

**Note:** Cannot delete your own account - button is hidden

## Form Validation Messages

### Success Messages
- ✅ "User updated successfully!"
- ✅ "User deleted successfully."

### Error Messages
- ❌ "Username is required."
- ❌ "Username must be at least 3 characters long."
- ❌ "Please select a valid account type."
- ❌ "Password must be at least 6 characters long (or leave blank to keep current password)."
- ❌ "Username already exists. Please choose a different one."
- ❌ "You cannot delete your own account."
- ❌ "Failed to update user. Please try again."
- ❌ "Failed to delete user. User may have associated records."

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Functionality
```javascript
// Clickable user rows
document.querySelectorAll('.user-row').forEach(row => {
    row.addEventListener('click', () => {
        window.location.href = 'edit.php?id=' + row.dataset.userId;
    });
});

// Delete confirmation
function confirmDelete() {
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this user?')) {
        document.getElementById('deleteForm').submit();
    }
}
```

### CSS Styling
- Hover effect on user rows (background: #f8f9fa)
- Cursor pointer on clickable rows
- Smooth transition effects
- Responsive form layout (grid)
- Delete button positioned to the right

### Form Handling
**Two forms on edit page:**
1. **Main form** - Handles save action
2. **Hidden form** - Handles delete action (triggered by JavaScript)

**POST Actions:**
- `action=save` - Updates user details
- `action=delete` - Deletes user

## Database Impact

### Update Queries
```sql
-- Update with new password
UPDATE users SET username = ?, password = ?, account_type = ? WHERE id = ?

-- Update without password change
UPDATE users SET username = ?, account_type = ? WHERE id = ?

-- Delete user
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?
```

### Foreign Key Considerations
Deleting a user may fail if they have:
- Timesheet entries (CASCADE delete will remove them)
- Jobs assigned as partner/manager/preparer (SET NULL)

## File Structure
```
Cursor1/
└── users/
    ├── index.php          ✅ Updated (clickable rows, removed Actions column)
    └── edit.php           🆕 New File (edit user form)
```
