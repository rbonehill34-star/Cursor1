# User Management Feature - Changes Summary

## Overview
Added a comprehensive User Management system accessible only to Administrators, and updated the login form to remove public registration access.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Login Form (`login/index.php`)
**Removed:**
- "Don't have an account?" section
- "Set Up New Account" button

**Result:** Login page is now cleaner and registration is only accessible through admin panel.

### 2. ✅ Practice Portal (`practice/index.php`)
**Added:**
- New "Users" card (Administrator only)
- Person icon (fas fa-user)
- Link to user management page (`../users`)
- Positioned after "Contact Form Responses" card

**Access:** Only visible to users with "Administrator" account type.

### 3. ✅ New Users Management Page (`users/index.php`)
**Created new directory and file:** `users/index.php`

**Features:**
- Lists all system users in a table
- Columns displayed:
  - **Username**: Shows username with "You" badge for current user
  - **Password**: Shows `●●●●●●●●` (passwords are hashed and not displayed for security)
  - **Account Type**: Color-coded badges
    - Red (Administrator)
    - Yellow (Manager)
    - Blue (Basic)
  - **Actions**: Delete button (disabled for current user)

**Top Action:**
- Green "New User" button (top right)
- Links to registration form

**Security Features:**
- Administrator access only
- Cannot delete your own account
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Foreign key constraint protection

### 4. ✅ Updated Register Form (`register/index.php`)
**Enhanced for dual context:**

**When accessed by Administrator:**
- Shows "Back to Users" link in navigation
- Shows "Practice Portal" link
- Footer shows "Back to User Management" button
- Auto-redirects to users page after successful creation (1.5 second delay)
- Success message: "User created successfully!"

**When accessed publicly (if enabled):**
- Shows standard navigation (Home, Contact, Login)
- Footer shows "Already have an account?" with Sign In button
- Standard success message: "Account created successfully! You can now login."

**Added:**
- `session_start()` to check admin status
- Conditional navigation and footer based on user role
- Auto-redirect for admin context

## File Structure
```
Cursor1/
├── login/
│   └── index.php          ✅ Updated (removed registration link)
├── practice/
│   └── index.php          ✅ Updated (added Users card)
├── users/                 🆕 New Directory
│   └── index.php          🆕 New File (user management page)
└── register/
    └── index.php          ✅ Updated (admin context support)
```

## Access Control

### Users Page Access
- **Required:** Administrator account type
- **Redirects:** Non-administrators are redirected to practice portal
- **Not logged in:** Redirected to login page

### Registration Page Access (New Behavior)
- **Admin Users:** Can access to create new users
- **Public:** No longer linked from login page
- **Direct URL:** Still accessible if someone knows the URL

## User Interface

### Users Table
| Username | Password | Account Type | Actions |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------|
| admin    | ●●●●●●●● | Administrator | Current User |
| john     | ●●●●●●●● | Manager      | [Delete] |
| jane     | ●●●●●●●● | Basic        | [Delete] |

### Badges
- **Administrator**: Red badge with white text
- **Manager**: Yellow badge with dark text
- **Basic**: Blue badge with white text
- **You**: Blue badge next to current user's username

### Buttons
- **New User**: Green button (top right of page)
- **Delete**: Red button (per user, except current user)
- **Back to Users**: Secondary button (in register page when admin)

## Security Considerations

### Password Display
- ✅ Passwords are never displayed (shown as ●●●●●●●●)
- ✅ Database stores hashed passwords only
- ✅ Password hashing uses PHP's `password_hash()` function

### Delete Protection
- ✅ Cannot delete your own account
- ✅ Confirmation dialog before deletion
- ✅ Database foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- ✅ Error messages when deletion fails due to associated records

### Access Control
- ✅ Administrator-only access enforced
- ✅ Session verification on every page load
- ✅ Redirects unauthorized users appropriately

## Database Impact

### Table: `users`
No structural changes - existing table used.

**Foreign Key Dependencies:**
- `timesheet.user_id` → `users.id` (CASCADE on delete)
- `jobs.partner_id` → `users.id` (SET NULL on delete)
- `jobs.manager_id` → `users.id` (SET NULL on delete)
- `jobs.preparer_id` → `users.id` (SET NULL on delete)

**Note:** Attempting to delete a user with associated timesheet records will fail due to CASCADE constraints.
